## Usage 
To generate a SVG file, open your terminal from the main folder and type in node index.js then follow the prompts for how you would like your SVG to appear, then navigate to the folder assets and locate logo.svg. To run jest, you will need to navigate to the lib folder and type in npm run test.



    

## Credits

## Features 
The main features are using jest, and inquirer. https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started // https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer 
As I researched SVG files, I found some really rad ways to make them look even better. In the future I may implement more variety in the inquirer input to add 
additional features to the SVG.







## Tests 
The tests performed were to ensure the colors added by the user would properly convey when renderer to SVG, please see the lib folder for the codes used to test the colors and render methods, and see the assets folder to see what has been rendered!
